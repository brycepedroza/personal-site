### Who am I?

I've been an Arizonan since the age of 2, and the only son in a split family of 5 children. Upon graduating from high school, I pursued my bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Arizona State University. Rarely have I ventured out beyond the Grand Canyon State for more than a week at a time (although I have journeyed on backpacking trips in the canyon itself).

At the end of my third year at ASU, I finally packed my car and spent my first summer away from friends and family at Walmart's headquarters in Bentonville, Arkansas, where I worked as a customer technology intern. The programming skills I learned at Arizona State University were critical in landing that incredible internship.

Shortly thereafter, my professor and mentor pushed me to apply to the accelerated master's program at ASU. By May of 2020, within five years at university, I graduated summa cum laude and garnered both my bachelor's and master's degree in Computer Science.

### What do I do?
Three weeks after I graduated and during the middle of a global pandemic, I was blessed to begin my first full-time job. I'm currently an information security engineer at Starbucks where the security organization excels in protecting Starbucks customers, partners, and brand.

My primary focus since beginning my internship in August of 2018 has been the Starbucks vulnerability management program. In this time, I have matured the program into a self-service model for technology partners to assess and remediate their exploitable infrastructure. I write code to programmatically assign ownership to the correct teams and maintain the vulnerability scanning and reporting services day-to-day; a full dev-sec-ops practice.

Other responsibilities include security automation in which I support other security engineering and identity management teams with increased operational efficiencies. This includes security orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR) in the form of playbook creation for our security operations center.

### What do I do when I'm not doing that?
2020 was a year of self-reflection and betterment. In a socially distanced society, I find the most enjoyment when I'm creating or learning a new skill. Programming will always be a passion of mine, but when I am not coding, I practice novice woodworking, play chess, or slackline. I'm currently reading _A Promised Land_ and have recently binged _Queen's Gambit_ and _Big Mouth_.

### What is this website?
By now, I'm sure you are wondering what the point of this site is, and rightfully so. To be honest, I don't know the answer. Perhaps it's my creative release expressed through code and text. Perhaps, a medium to inspire and challenge others beyond their comfort. Or perhaps, even a witty blog that draws in thousands of entertained readers, but I wouldn't count on that. Regardless, now that you're here, I encourage you to take a few minutes to explore and take a break from the information-dense interwebs and social media that got you here. You deserve it :)
